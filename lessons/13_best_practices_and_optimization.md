# Best Practices and Optimization in Shell Scripting

This lesson covers essential best practices for shell script organization, style guidelines, performance optimization techniques, and important security considerations. Adhering to these practices will help you write more efficient, maintainable, and secure shell scripts.

## 1. Script Organization and Style Guidelines

### 1.1 Script Structure

A well-organized shell script typically follows this structure:

1. Shebang (#!/bin/bash)
2. Script description and usage
3. Global variables and constants
4. Function definitions
5. Main script logic
6. Exit with appropriate status

Example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Script: example.sh
# Description: Demonstrates script structure
# Usage: ./example.sh [options]

# Global variables and constants
VERSION="1.0"
LOG_FILE="/var/log/example.log"

# Function definitions
log_message() {
    local message="$1"
    echo "$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') - $message" >> "$LOG_FILE"
}

# Main script logic
main() {
    log_message "Script started"
    # Main logic here
    log_message "Script finished"
}

main "$@"
exit 0
```

### 1.2 Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive names for variables and functions
- Use lowercase for variables and uppercase for constants
- Use underscores to separate words in names

Example:

```bash
user_name="John Doe"
MAX_RETRIES=3

calculate_average() {
    # Function logic
}
```

### 1.3 Indentation and Formatting

- Use consistent indentation (typically 2 or 4 spaces)
- Align command blocks and case statements
- Use blank lines to separate logical sections

Example:

```bash
if [ "$condition" = true ]; then
    command1
    command2
else
    command3
    command4
fi

case "$variable" in
    pattern1)
        command1
        ;;
    pattern2)
        command2
        ;;
esac
```

### 1.4 Comments and Documentation

- Add a header comment to each script explaining its purpose and usage
- Comment complex logic or non-obvious code
- Use TODO or FIXME comments for future improvements

Example:

```bash
# TODO: Implement error handling for network failures
fetch_data() {
    # Function logic
}

# FIXME: This function is inefficient for large datasets
process_data() {
    # Function logic
}
```

### 1.5 Use Functions

- Break down complex logic into functions
- Keep functions focused on a single task
- Use local variables within functions

Example:

```bash
validate_input() {
    local input="$1"
    # Validation logic
}

process_data() {
    local data="$1"
    # Processing logic
}

main() {
    local input="$1"
    if validate_input "$input"; then
        process_data "$input"
    else
        echo "Invalid input"
        exit 1
    fi
}
```

### 1.6 Use Version Control

- Use Git or another version control system
- Commit frequently with descriptive commit messages
- Use branches for developing new features

## 2. Performance Optimization Techniques

### 2.1 Minimize External Commands

- Use shell built-ins when possible
- Combine multiple commands using pipes and redirection

Example:

```bash
# Inefficient
files=$(ls)
count=$(echo "$files" | wc -l)

# Optimized
count=$(ls | wc -l)
```

### 2.2 Use Command Substitution Judiciously

- Avoid unnecessary command substitution
- Use variables to store command results when used multiple times

Example:

```bash
# Inefficient
if [ "$(date +%A)" = "Monday" ]; then
    echo "It's $(date +%A), time to work!"
fi

# Optimized
current_day=$(date +%A)
if [ "$current_day" = "Monday" ]; then
    echo "It's $current_day, time to work!"
fi
```

### 2.3 Use Efficient Looping Constructs

- Use `while read` for processing file contents
- Use C-style for loops for numerical iterations

Example:

```bash
# Efficient file reading
while IFS= read -r line; do
    process_line "$line"
done < input_file

# Efficient numerical loop
for ((i=0; i<1000; i++)); do
    process_number "$i"
done
```

### 2.4 Avoid Unnecessary Subshells

- Use command grouping instead of subshells when possible

Example:

```bash
# Inefficient (creates a subshell)
(cd /tmp && rm *tmp*)

# Optimized (uses command grouping)
{ cd /tmp && rm *tmp*; }
```

### 2.5 Use Associative Arrays for Lookups

- Use associative arrays instead of repeated grep or case statements

Example:

```bash
declare -A month_days=(
    [Jan]=31 [Feb]=28 [Mar]=31 [Apr]=30 [May]=31 [Jun]=30
    [Jul]=31 [Aug]=31 [Sep]=30 [Oct]=31 [Nov]=30 [Dec]=31
)

days=${month_days[$month]}
```

### 2.6 Optimize File Operations

- Use `mapfile` or `readarray` for reading files into arrays
- Use process substitution to avoid temporary files

Example:

```bash
# Efficient file reading into array
mapfile -t lines < input_file

# Avoid temporary files
diff <(sort file1) <(sort file2)
```

### 2.7 Use Caching for Expensive Operations

- Cache results of expensive operations

Example:

```bash
get_expensive_result() {
    if [ -z "$cached_result" ]; then
        cached_result=$(expensive_operation)
    fi
    echo "$cached_result"
}
```

## 3. Security Considerations

### 3.1 Use Secure Permissions

- Set appropriate permissions on scripts and sensitive files
- Avoid running scripts with unnecessary privileges

Example:

```bash
chmod 700 myscript.sh  # Only owner can read, write, and execute
```

### 3.2 Validate and Sanitize Input

- Always validate and sanitize user input
- Use pattern matching to ensure input meets expected format

Example:

```bash
validate_integer() {
    [[ "$1" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]] || return 1
}

if validate_integer "$user_input"; then
    process_number "$user_input"
else
    echo "Invalid input. Please enter a number."
    exit 1
fi
```

### 3.3 Use Quotes to Prevent Word Splitting and Globbing

- Always quote variables to prevent unexpected behavior

Example:

```bash
file_name="My Document.txt"
rm "$file_name"  # Correct
rm $file_name    # Incorrect, may cause issues with spaces
```

### 3.4 Use Restricted Shell for Untrusted Scripts

- Use `set -r` or `set -o restricted` for scripts that process untrusted input

### 3.5 Avoid Storing Sensitive Information in Scripts

- Use environment variables or secure external files for sensitive data
- Never hardcode passwords or API keys in scripts

Example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
DB_PASSWORD=$(cat /path/to/secure/password_file)
```

### 3.6 Use Secure Temporary Files

- Use `mktemp` to create secure temporary files
- Always clean up temporary files, even if the script exits unexpectedly

Example:

```bash
temp_file=$(mktemp)
trap 'rm -f "$temp_file"' EXIT
```

### 3.7 Be Cautious with Eval and Dynamic Execution

- Avoid `eval` and other forms of dynamic execution when possible
- If necessary, strictly validate any dynamically executed code

### 3.8 Use SetUID and SetGID Judiciously

- Avoid using SetUID and SetGID bits on shell scripts
- If necessary, use a small C wrapper program instead

### 3.9 Implement Proper Error Handling and Logging

- Always check for and handle errors
- Implement logging for auditing and debugging purposes

Example:

```bash
if ! some_command; then
    logger -p user.err "Error occurred in script $0"
    exit 1
fi
```
